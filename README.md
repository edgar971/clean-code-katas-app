## What is Clean Code Katas?
The idea is simple, weekly programming challenges aimed towards learning how to write clean and maintainable code. Each challenge is short, between 30-60 minutes. You can then submit the challenge to get feedback from others and also help others. There will also be a leaderboard of some of the best submissions and top users.
